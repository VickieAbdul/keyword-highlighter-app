# Keyword Highlighter

This project uses **Streamlit** and **spaCy** to create an app that highlights specific keywords and named entities from a text input. It also offers enhanced entity recognition with custom rules for AI and tech-related entities.

## Features

- Enter your text and highlight specific words.
- Recognizes and highlights named entities (e.g., people, organizations, products).
- Custom rules to improve tech entity recognition (e.g., OpenAI, GPT-4).
- Displays extracted entities in a table and provides a downloadable CSV.
